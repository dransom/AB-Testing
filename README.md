# A/B Testing
## by Dane

## Overview

This project is some statistical and, specifically, A/B testing practice.  Since A/B testing is not something I use in my day-job, I decided to run through how to do it to gain the experience.

The goal of the project is to understand A/B testing for an e-commerce site.  The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data is all worked up in a Jupyter notebook and a PDF copy is also available for easy viewing.
